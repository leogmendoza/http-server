# Why? üóø
During my co-op at Xandar Kardian, I gained a bit of experience in backend development... but I always wondered how server calls worked at a lower level. So why _not_ create a web server that handles HTTP requests myself?

# Run It! üôè

## Pre-reqs
- Windows (sorry Linux/Mac users ü•Ä)
- CMake

## Build Instructions
1. Clone my repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leogmen/http-server.git
   cd http-server
2. Create build directory
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
3. Configure project with CMake
   ```bash
   cmake ..
5. Build executable
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
6. Run the server!
   ```bash
   ./http_server

# Hmmm.. now what to do???
